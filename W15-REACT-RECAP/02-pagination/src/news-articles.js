    "Article": "HONG KONG: Asian markets tumbled Tuesday following painful losses in New York and Europe while the euro sat near nine-year lows as political uncertainty in Greece fanned renewed fears it could leave the eurozone.Oil prices, which fell below the psychological $50 a barrel mark in US trade, edged up marginally but remained under pressure owing to a global supply glut, weak demand and a stronger dollar.Tokyo tumbled 2.50 percent, Hong Kong lost 0.89 percent, Sydney eased 1.67 percent, Seoul was 1.30 percent lower while Shanghai reversed earlier losses to gain 0.70 percent.The first full week of the new year got off to a traumatic start for dealers as they bet a January 25 general election in Greece will see a victory for the the left-wing Syriza party.Markets fear the party will roll back austerity measures required under the IMF-EU bailout of the country, which could in turn lead it to exit the eurozone.The year is \"barely three trading days old and already the two biggest themes that were predicted to affect the markets this year are making headlines: oversupply of commodities and the eurozone,\" Evan Lucas, a markets strategist in Melbourne at IG Ltd., wrote in an email to clients, according to Bloomberg News.At the weekend, Der Spiegel quoted German government sources as saying they consider Greece�s exit \"almost inevitable\" if Syriza wins the snap poll.Chancellor Angela Merkel and finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble had come to consider Athens� removal from the bloc would be \"manageable\", the magazine said.However, investors were spooked and on Monday Greek stocks sank more than 5 percent, while the Paris, Madrid and Milan exchanges fell more than 3 percent.- Oil below $50 a barrel -The Dow dived 1.86 percent, the S&P 500 fell 1.83 percent and the Nasdaq lost 1.57 percent.In currency trade the euro sank to $1.1864 Monday, its lowest level since March 2006. On Tuesday morning the single currency recovered slightly buying $1.1943.The euro was meanwhile at 142.58 yen against 142.74 yen in US trade and well down from the 144.58 yen Friday.Adding to downward pressure is increased speculation that the European Central Bank will buy eurozone government bonds to counter deflation risks.The dollar was at 119.40 yen early Tuesday, compared with 119.61 in New York Monday and also well down from 120.46 yen Friday.Oil prices were marginally up Tuesday after slipping below $50 for the first time in more than five years in New York.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for February delivery rose eight cents to $50.12 while Brent crude for February gained 14 cents to $53.25. WTI tapped $49.95 Monday.The cost of crude has plunged since June as supplies outstrip demand with key consumer China slowing down, the eurozone struggling and the dollar, in which it is priced, strengthening.A decision late last year by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to maintain output despite the glut has also cut into prices.\"The fundamentals of oil are unlikely to change in the first half of this year, which will see oil bedding down into its bear market for months to come,\" IG�s Lucas said.Gold was at $1,203.59.40 an ounce, compared with $1,196.40 on Monday.

    "Article": "NEW YORK: US oil prices Monday slipped below $50 a barrel for the first time in more than five years as the surging dollar and news of additional supplies extended a six-month rout.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for February delivery, in free fall since June, ended at $50.04 a barrel, down $2.65 or five percent. The contract got as low as $49.95 a barrel earlier in the session, its lowest level since May 1, 2009.European benchmark Brent oil for February delivery fell $3.31 to $53.11 a barrel in London.Monday�s slide in oil prices followed indications of rising output from key producers Russia and Iraq at a time when forecasters have trimmed their demand projections due to weak global economic growth.The breaching of the psychologically important $50 level also came on a turbulent day for global financial markets. US stocks fell nearly two percent, approaching the drops in European equity markets as the euro plunged to a nine-year low on revived eurozone worries.A long rally in the greenback, which gained 11 percent last year against a basket of major currencies, has weighed on the dollar-priced oil market by making crude more expensive for buyers using weaker currencies.Oil prices could fall further still, analysts say.\"There�s serious concern the bottom�s not in yet,\" said Kyle Cooper, managing partner at IAF Advisors in Houston. \"Basically everyone who�s taken a stab at the bottom has been wrong.\"\"Oil prices attempted to stabilize during the last two weeks, but the fundamentals remain weak,\" said Gene McGillian, broker and analyst at Tradition Energy. \"The market is trying to come to a bottom. It could be anybody�s guess, but it appears we still have more to go.\"Fawad Razaqzada, a technical analyst at Forex.com., said the drop below $50 a barrel could trigger more selling, paving the way for oil to fall as low as $45 or $40 a barrel in the coming weeks.-Weak fundamentals-The retreat in prices comes on the heels of a multi-year boom in US oil production that has shaken the global petroleum market and put the US in a league with oil giants Russia and Saudi Arabia.Other leading producers are also pumping aggressively. Iraq�s oil ministry last week released figures showing that December crude exports reached their highest since 1980.Meanwhile, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has consistently ruled out action despite the months-long slide in prices.In November, the cartel met in Vienna and took no action, as key powerbrokers like Saudi Arabian oil minister Ali al-Naimi said he preferred for the market to balance itself. In December, Naimi told a Middle East publication the group would take the same hands-off approach even if oil fell to $20 a barrel.Meanwhile, economic growth remains uncertain in Europe and in many emerging economies, such as China and Brazil. The International Energy Agency in December projected global crude inventories could rise by nearly 300 million barrels in the first six months of 2015. The agency also cut its demand outlook by more than 200,000 barrels a day for 2015.Energy equities, by far the worst performing sector in the S&P 500 last year, suffered more pain Monday. Dow member Chevron fell 4.0 percent, while oil-services giant Schlumberger lost 2.6 percent.Key US oil companies like ConocoPhillips and shale producer Continental Resources have cut their drilling budgets for 2015.Still, analysts expect US output to continue to rise this year, owing to investments that have already been made. That will put more pressure on crude prices.\"I still think one of the primary drivers of the market is US oil production and I really don�t see US oil production growth slowing appreciably in the first quarter,\" Cooper said.

The Energy Information Administration's oil inventory report is due Wednesday at 1530 GMT.Outside the United States, some of the world's biggest oil traders have booked supertankers to store at least 25 million barrels at sea.\"Once floating storage starts, there is very little support on the downside for Brent spreads,\" analysts Energy Aspects said.With oil producer club OPEC deciding late last year to maintain its output despite slowing Asian and European economic growth, a glut has also appeared outside the United States.\"The closing gap looks to be solidifying Saudi Arabia's strategy to curb shale production and protect market share,\" ANZ bank said.",

US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for February gained $1.09 at $47.34.\"How low the market�s floor will be is anyone�s guess,\" the Paris-based IEA energy watchdog said in a monthly report published on Friday.\"A price recovery -- barring any major disruption -- may not be imminent, but signs are mounting that the tide will turn.\"Crude futures have more than halved since June, crashing on stubborn worries over global oversupply and weak demand in a faltering world economy.The IEA cautioned Friday that prices were expected to keep falling in the short-term.\"The IEA have hedged their bets somewhat by saying the tide may turn,\" noted CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson.He added that the \"market is very oversold and was probably due a rebound\".European benchmark Brent had tumbled Tuesday to $45.19 per barrel, hitting the lowest level since March 2009.The IEA added Friday that the dramatic collapse in oil prices was still insufficient to stimulate crude consumption, because weakness in the economy has cancelled out the benefits of cheaper crude.The agency maintained its oil demand forecast for 2015, expecting it to grow by 0.9 million barrels a day to reach 93.3 million barrels.The oil market rebounded Friday after plunging the previous day on news that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries had overproduced in December, while it also cut its global demand outlook.The 12-nation OPEC cartel, which produces about one third of global supplies, said in a monthly report Thursday that its production rose to 30.2 million barrels a day in December, above its 30 million limit.It also projected that demand for its oil would fall to 28.8 million barrels per day this year from 29.1 million in 2014.\"The yo-yo effect of the crude oil prices can be attributed to the uncertainty in the market,\" said Shailaja Nair, associate editorial director at energy information provider Platts, pointing to an \"unstable dollar\" and an \"irregular equity market\".\"OPEC has just forecasted a drop in demand for its oil this year and this could mean that the price rally we saw this week is unlikely to last,\" she said.Despite the global supply glut, OPEC decided in November to maintain its collective output ceiling at 30 million barrels of oil per day.Cartel kingpin Saudi Arabia has stated that OPEC will not cut production even if the price drops to $20 per barrel, in a move aimed at hurting US shale oil producers.

    "Article": "SINGAPORE: Saudi Arabia's new king is expected to continue a policy of keeping oil output steady to drive out rival producers, though the royal succession has focused market attention on the future of the kingdom's long-serving oil minister.King Abdullah died early on Friday and his brother Salman became king, the royal court in the world's top oil exporter said in a statement.Salman named his half-brother Muqrin as heir, rapidly moving to forestall any succession crisis at a moment when Saudi Arabia faces unprecedented turmoil on its borders.While the new king is not seen as likely to change Abdullah's policies of keeping output high to protect the OPEC cartel's market share, some analysts said the succession has focused attention on the future of the oil minister Ali Al-Naimi.\"King Abdullah was the architect of the current strategy to keep production high and force out smaller players instead of cutting,\" said John Kilduff, partner, Again Capital LLC in New York, adding that he expected Salman to keep production high.FGE analyst Tushar Bansal said: \"By and large, as of now, no major change is expected in Saudi policies\" but he said the market would focus on whether the oil minister might step down.\"Ali Al-Naimi has been the oil minister since 1995... It was reported that he expressed a desire to step down, but King Abdullah asked him to stay on for as long as he is around. So, the real question is, if there is a new oil minister soon, will it lead to a change in Saudi energy policy?\"IHS oil consultant Victor Shum said speculation over the fate of the oil minister could add to market uncertainty though he did not expect a change of minister or in overall policy.\"The decision on Saudi Arabia to keep pumping (oil) was made regardless of who the king may be,\" said Shum.Saudi leaders were also unlikely to want to repeat some previous policy misfires.In the 1980s, Saudi Arabia cut its own output to prop up prices in the face of falling demand and rising supplies from non-OPEC suppliers but was dealt a double blow from lower prices and reduced output.Saudi policymakers would be determined not to make the same mistake again, analysts said.Crude oil futures jumped on Friday after news of the Saudi king's death but later came off their highs and were still trading at levels more than 50 percent below their most recent peaks in June, 2014. [O/R]\"This little spike in prices is understandable... It should be sold off quickly and it won't last long at all,\" said Mark Keenan, an analyst at Societe Generale.",

    "Article": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's ongoing fuel shortage that has led to worsening power blackouts is weighing on its credit worthiness and hindering its ability to meet key reform targets laid out by the IMF, ratings agency Moody�s warned Monday. The country is currently in the grip of one of its worst power crises in years due to a shortfall in imported oil, with the situation exacerbated Sunday by an attack on a key powerline in restive Balochistan province. Moody�s said that increasing energy imports without addressing structural issues that create so-called circular debt \"will further strain Pakistan's budget and balance of payments, a credit negative\". \"Fuel shortages also reflect the strained finances of state-owned distribution companies and the fuel importer, Pakistan State Oil corporation, and are a setback to the sector's progress on reforms made so far under Pakistan's financial support program with the International Monetary Fund.\"The IMF granted a $6.6-billion loan to Pakistan in September 2013 on the condition that it carry out extensive economic reforms, particularly in the energy and taxation sectors.Moody�s, which in July 2014 upgraded Pakistan's rating outlook from \"negative\" to \"stable\" in a boon for the shaky South Asian economy, said that structural reforms had been a \"key driver\" in its decision last year. \"Circular debt\" -- brought on by the dual effect of the government setting low electricity prices and customers failing to pay -- is at the heart of the crisis. State utilities lose money, and cannot pay private power generating companies, which in turn cannot pay the oil and gas suppliers, who cut off the supply. The fuel crisis began last week when Pakistan State Oil was forced to slash imports because banks refused to extend any more credit to the government-owned company, which supplies 80 percent of the country�s oil. The shortfall led to long queues of angry motorists at petrol stations, though these have since dissipated as fuel supplies have reached the pumps. But Moody�s warned that the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, which made solving the energy crisis a key campaign pledge, had so far failed to offer policy solutions and increasing oil supplies would only add to the fiscal burden. \"The government�s targeted fiscal deficit of 4.5 percent of GDP in fiscal 2015 from 4.7 percent in fiscal 2014 is already impeded by delays in implementing electricity tariff adjustments and legal challenges related to tax collections,\" it said. Increasing fuel imports, which currently comprise 35 percent of total imports would further weigh on Pakistan�s import bill, it added.",

Crude has shed nearly 60 percent of its value in an almost uninterrupted slide since June due to a supply glut, largely boosted by robust US shale-oil production and weaker global economic growth.The greenback has been strengthening for months, making dollar-priced oil relatively more expensive, adding to the pressure on the oil market.A slight easing in the dollar Tuesday against major rival currencies such as the euro, yen and pound underpinned the buying, Cooper said.\"I didn�t see anything bullish today\" for WTI, he said. \"Equities are down, durable goods (are) not that good.\"New orders for long-lasting US industrial goods unexpectedly fell in December, by a steep 3.4 percent, signaling some persistent weakness in the manufacturing sector.Saudi Aramco, the world�s largest oil company in terms of crude production and exports, acknowledged that prices have fallen too far but it was up to the market, not OPEC producers, to shore them up.\"It�s too low for everybody,\" said Khalid al-Falih, the president of the state-owned energy giant, told a conference in Riyadh. \"I think even consumers start to suffer in the long term.\"Falih also said US shale-oil production is important for the world�s long-term energy future and Saudi Aramco has earmarked an additional $7 billion for its own shale projects.The kingdom is the leading exporter and top producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which provides about a third of global oil supplies.In November, OPEC resisted calls to reduce output in the face of falling prices, keeping its output ceiling at 30 million barrels per day in a decision that exacerbated the global price slump.

    "Article": "KARACHI: State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor on Thursday urged the country�s Islamic banks to develop ways to reward their customers in line with a surge in the sector�s profitability, or face regulatory action. Islamic finance is experiencing a revival in Pakistan, aided by an ambitious five-year plan that regulators hope will double the industry�s share of the banking sector to 20 percent by 2020.A growing client base and improving asset quality helped Islamic banks post profits before tax of 12 billion rupees ($119.1 million) in the third quarter of last year, almost double the year-earlier amount, central bank data shows. But regulators want to tackle consumer perceptions that Islamic banks falter when it comes to social responsibility and ethical banking practices.The average financing-to-deposit spread - the difference between what banks charge for financing and what they pay their depositors - for all lenders, Islamic and conventional, remains high and should be \"reasonably rationalised\", central bank governor Ashraf Wathra said in a speech to a gathering of industry executives on Monday. He did not specify a satisfactory level, but singled out Islamic banks as the ones needing to reward customers in line with a rise in profits.\"Banks were advised to come up with their own solutions or the SBP will apply sharia-compliant measures to address the issue,\" said Wathra. He did not elaborate, but in the past the central bank has prescribed minimum targets for banks to lend to specific sectors of the economy such as agriculture and small business. Islamic banks follow religious principles which ban the charging of interest and gambling, and stress the sharing of risk and profits. The industry has developed a range of sharia-compliant financial tools, some with greater profit-sharing qualities than others. Islamic banks fall short when it comes to using strongly profit-sharing instruments such as musharaka, whose share of overall Islamic financing in Pakistan was only 10.1 percent as of September, compared to 4.2 percent a year earlier. Musharaka is a partnership in which two or more parties agree to provide capital, sharing both profits and losses according to a stipulated ratio. By contrast, murabaha - a cost-plus-profit arrangement where one party agrees to buy merchandise for another - commands the lion�s share of financing by the country�s Islamic banks, at 30.3 percent. Murabaha is often criticised for lacking economic substance and its resemblance to a conventional loan.",

He added that prices could \"fluctuate by increasing up to $10 and falling up to $10\" in the short term.Deep cuts in capital spending by major oil companies, including new announcements Tuesday by BP and BG Group, had suggested there would be tighter supplies in the future.

Pakistan also informed the IMF of its expenditure of Rs. 150 billion on the implementation of the National Action Plan (NAP) as well as repatriation of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs).Also agreed upon was Rs.60 billion in tax cuts for Pakistan, while it was decided that the target for tax cuts should reach Rs. 2750 million by June.Dar said that Pakistan�s foreign exchange reserves have increased to over $15 billion, entitling the country to receive subsidised loans.However, due to the price reduction of petrol in the country, tax revenue decreased to Rs. 68 billion. �Tax revenues were below the second-quarter indicative target by about 0.1 percent of GDP due in part to legal challenges to some revenue measures and to the fiscal effects of the plunge in international oil prices,� said a press statement from the IMF mission. �While progress has been made in addressing the structural impediments to higher and more inclusive growth, important challenges remain, such as steps to enhance the independence of the SBP, permanently resolve energy sector deficiencies, complete the legal framework for deposit insurance, and privatize or restructure public enterprises,� noted the IMF.",

The dip followed a cut of 94 rigs the previous week.Bloomberg News reported that the rig count was standing at its lowest level since December 2011.The drop, coupled with announcements of deep cuts in capital spending by major oil companies including BP and BG Group, suggests tighter supplies in the future.Oil prices have plunged by about 50 percent from their June peaks, largely owing to a surge in global reserves boosted by robust US shale production.Teo said a surprisingly robust jobs report in the United States was also supporting prices as it heralds stronger demand.The Labor Department on Friday reported that the world�s biggest economy added 257,000 jobs in January and revised upward already healthy growth in the previous two months.The unemployment rate edged up to 5.7 percent from 5.6 percent, but that was in part because more people were actively seeking jobs.

    "Article": "LONDON: British bank HSBC Holdings Plc admitted on Sunday failings by its Swiss subsidiary, in response to media reports it helped wealthy customers dodge taxes and conceal millions of dollars of assets.\"We acknowledge and are accountable for past compliance and control failures,\" HSBC said on Sunday after news outlets including French newspaper Le Monde and Britain�s The Guardian published allegations about its Swiss private bank. The Guardian, along with other news outlets, cited documents obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) via Le Monde.HSBC said that its Swiss arm had not been fully integrated into HSBC after its purchase in 1999, allowing \"significantly lower\" standards of compliance and due diligence to persist.The Guardian alleged in its report that the files showed HSBC's Swiss bank routinely allowed clients to withdraw �bricks� of cash, often in foreign currencies which were of little use in Switzerland, marketed schemes which were likely to enable wealthy clients to avoid European taxes and colluded with some to conceal undeclared accounts from domestic tax authorities.HSBC said the Swiss private banking industry, long known for its secrecy, operated differently in the past and this may have resulted in HSBC having had \"a number of clients that may not have been fully compliant with their applicable tax obligations.\"Its private bank, especially its Swiss arm, had undergone \"a radical transformation\" in recent years, it said in a detailed four-page statement.HSBC's Swiss private bank was largely acquired as part of its purchase of Republic National Bank of New York and Safra Republic Holdings, a US private bank.HSBC said the number of accounts in its Swiss private bank had fallen from 30,412 in 2007 to 10,343 at the end of last year and it was cooperating with authorities investigating tax matters.The data was supplied by Herve Falciani, a former IT employee of HSBC's Swiss private bank. HSBC said Falciani downloaded details of accounts and clients at the end of 2006 and early 2007. French authorities have obtained data on thousands of the customers and shared them with tax authorities elsewhere, including Argentina.Switzerland has charged Falciani, who Reuters was unable to reach for comment, with industrial espionage and breaching the country's secrecy laws. Falciani has previously told Reuters he is a whistleblower trying to help governments track down citizens who used Swiss accounts to evade tax.Some of the details of the list have been released before. The names of 2,000 Greeks with HSBC accounts was made public in 2010 and dubbed the \"Lagarde List\" after former French finance minister Christine Lagarde. France passed the names to Greece to help it crack down on tax evasion.",

Citing a major shakeup in the oil markets, the IEA said in its five-year forecast that prices will recover from current levels of around $50-60 per barrel but remain considerably below the more than $100 price tags reached the slump began in June.\"The global oil market looks set to begin a new chapter of its history, with markedly changing demand dynamics, sweeping shifts in crude trade and product supply, and dramatically different roles for OPEC and non-OPEC producers in regulating upstream supply,\" the IEA said.It added that it sees market rebalancing occurring \"relatively swiftly\", with increases in inventories halting mid-year and the market tightening.\"This morning�s slight dip is likely due to the IEA report that predicts only a slow recovery for oil prices. However this is only in the short term as the market fundamentals have not changed,\" said Shailaja Nair, associate editorial director at energy information provider Platts.Prices have plunged from their mid-2014 peaks largely owing to a surge in global reserves boosted by robust US shale production and weak global demand.

The continuous large increases of crude inventories verify a possible slowdown of US oil demand,\" she added.Globally, crude supplies are being boosted after oil fields in eastern Libya resumed pumping to the Hariga port after a pipeline was repaired, Bloomberg News reported.And Oman, the biggest Middle East producer outside the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, plans to ramp up output to 980,000 barrels a day this year.Crude prices lost around 60 percent of their value between June and late January owing to an oversupply in world markets, a weak global economy and a strong dollar that made oil expensive to purchase for holders of rival currencies.The euro continued to be pressured by the dollar Monday despite eurozone ministers tentatively agreeing to extend Greece�s bailout by four months.While oil prices have won support in recent weeks on a decline in operating US oil rigs and as energy giants cut investment, markets-watchers say volatility is likely to continue for some time.Daniel Ang, an investment analyst with Phillip Futures in Singapore, said a sustained rebound for oil prices was unlikely because of a global oversupply of the commodity, noting that US crude production has remained strong at above 9.2 million barrels per day.He said a strike in US oil refineries has led to an excess of crude in the American market as less of the product is being sent to the facilities for refining.Workers at three major US oil refineries operated with Royal Dutch Shell went on strike on Saturday in a dispute over safer working conditions, the United Steelworkers (USW) union said.About 1,350 employees in three refineries and chemical plants are affected by the latest strike action, which mirrored walkouts on other sites launched earlier this month.

Jononov went on to say that hydroelectric generation accounted for 76 percent of the total energy output of the country and the total cost of the project which would lighten Pakistan through Tajik electricity will be financed by the World Bank, ADB, Islamic Development Bank and other donors.He also said that this project would not only alleviate electricity shortages in Pakistan but would also replace fuel based electricity generation for Afghanistan and Pakistan, adding that it would also establish Afghanistan as a viable transit country and offer transmission capacity for other countries during the off peak season.He further said that it would also create a viable governance mechanism to build confidence among neighbours as major share of the export will be used by Pakistan and approximately 300 MW will be utilised by Afghanistan.",

    "Article": "ISLAMABAD: The Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR) has begun chasing wealthy tax-dodgers who enjoy lives of extravagance and luxury, but revenue officials face huge challenges in trying to force the very richest � and most influential � to pay up.Pakistan's tax-to-GDP ratio of 9.5 percent is among the lowest in the world and the government is under pressure from foreign donors and lenders, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to increase collection to boost the struggling economy.Revenue authorities say they have identified about a quarter of a million new taxpayers who they project will add around 14 billion rupees ($140 million) to government coffers.Broadening the tax base and improving the economy after years of drift and sluggish growth under the last government was a key pledge in Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif�s 2013 election campaign, when he was swept to power for a third time.Currently less than one percent of Pakistanis pay income tax and the government collected just $8 billion in total income tax in the 2013-14 fiscal year � barely enough to cover just the country�s defence expenditure of $7 billion.The finance ministry is aiming to boost the tax-to-GDP ratio to 15 percent in the current fiscal year ending June 30.As part of those efforts, the FBR is compiling lifestyle and vehicle data to try to trace unregistered taxpayers, including wealthy landlords and businessmen zipping between their luxury homes in imported Mercedes.\"We are collecting information from the vehicle registration authority, car manufacturers, utility companies, telecom companies and property registration offices and tracing people who are not paying any tax,\" FBR spokesman Shahid Hussain told AFP.Taxpayer profilesThe data is used to generate profiles of potential taxpayers, after which demands are issued for them to pay income tax.\"FBR has already issued notices to 261,250 potential tax payers,\" Hussain told AFP, adding that that new taxpayers have paid 570 million rupees since the crackdown started.It is not just dodgy businessmen who have been caught � several lawmakers have been found paying either no tax or very little and not filing their mandatory annual tax statements.The FBR has taken punitive measures against some \"chronic defaulters\", freezing nearly 300 bank accounts, seizing more than 100 vehicles, putting 78 properties up for sale and issuing arrest warrants in 40 cases.\"Employing information technology, the FBR is creating a central database which would contain information about all taxpayers and nobody will be left undetected,\" Hussain said.A new FBR department tasked with broadening the tax net started working in July 2013 and within one year it started showing results, he added.But Pakistan is a country where wealth and political influence go hand in hand. For generations, landowners and industrialists have given patronage to political parties and scant attention has been paid to their assets by the taxman.Changing this privileged arrangement is a tricky proposition.Umar Cheema, an investigative journalist for Pakistani daily The News who has done several major exposes on tax-dodgers, says the FBR�s commitment is encouraging, but he does not expect them to net any big fish.�War on tax cheats�\"FBR is after those who can�t influence them,\" Cheema told AFP, citing several well-known tycoons considered among Pakistan�s richest whose names were missing from a list of the country�s top 100 taxpayers.\"It can be done only by waging a war against tax cheaters without discrimination of good and bad cheaters,\" Cheema said.Pakistan�s central bank said in a recent report that tax revenue growth was not keeping up with budget targets.The tax take grew 11.7 percent in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, against an annual target of 26.9 percent � but this was only half the growth of the same period during the previous fiscal year, according to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).The central bank has urged the government to simplify tax procedures and do more to increase the documentation of the economy.A vast amount of business in Pakistan is done off the books, making transactions hard to trace and levy dues on.\"Although FBR has taken a number of measures to increase tax collection, these focused more on deductions at source, and/or increasing the tax rates,\" a recent SBP report said, warning such measures had enjoyed \"limited success\" in the past.The IMF, though, has said the government�s reform programme � tied to a $6.6 billion loan from the Washington-based lender � was on track, and expects growth to accelerate to 4.3 percent in the 2014-15 fiscal year from 4.1 percent previously.But even with growth quickening and officials insisting they are making inroads, challenges to the government�s efforts to gather taxes remain considerable.",

Iran denies the allegations.\"Prices are likely to remain in a tight range for the next two weeks until the market gets more clarity on the ongoing negotiations between Iran and the US over the lifting of sanctions,\" said Sanjeev Gupta, head of the Asia-Pacific oil and gas practice at business consultancy EY.

    "Article": "London: World oil prices sank Friday after the International Energy Agency warned over the price outlook amid bulging global supplies.In midday London deals, European benchmark Brent North Sea crude for April delivery fell 57 cents to $56.51 a barrel.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for April shed 72 cents to $46.33 a barrel.\"Crude oil prices extended losses ... as investors remained cautious following the bearish IEA oil monthly report, high levels of crude oil inventories and the strong US dollar rally,\" said Sucden analyst Myrto Sokou.The Paris-based IEA energy watchdog warned Friday that the recent rebound in oil prices was built on flimsy foundations.Prices collapsed by 60 percent to about $40 between June and late January due to global oil oversupply, a weak world economy and the strong dollar.However, the market has since rebounded somewhat following a slowdown in US oil-drilling activities.\"Behind the facade of stability, the rebalancing triggered by the price collapse has yet to run its course, and it might be overly optimistic to expect it to proceed smoothly,\" said the Paris-based IEA, which advises energy consuming nations.It noted that a key driver in the recovery in oil prices has been drops in the number of rigs drilling for shale oil in the United States.\"Yet US supply so far shows precious little sign of slowing down. Quite to the contrary, it continues to defy expectations,\" said the IEA in its monthly report, which sharply revised up output estimates for the end of last year and forecasts for the start of 2015.The IEA hiked its demand forecasts for every quarter this year, with the annual 2015 figure bumped up by 100,000 barrels per day to 93.5 mbpd, compared with its previous forecast given last month.In earlier Asian trading, the oil market had risen on news of a deal to end a strike at US refineries.Crude futures had fallen Thursday after a government report showed surging US stockpiles, adding to a global oversupply.The US Department of Energy on Wednesday said inventories hit a fresh record high of 448.9 million barrels last week, while stockpiles at the Cushing terminal hub in Oklahoma -- the price settlement point for WTI -- also increased.Bloomberg News meanwhile reported the United Steelworkers union representing 30,000 US oil workers had reached a tentative deal on a four-year contract with Royal Dutch Shell that could see a mass walkout brought to a close.Another development affecting the market was an announcement on Monday by the US Energy Information Administration raising its crude production forecast this year to 9.35 million barrels per day from 9.30 million.

    "Article": "London: New York oil prices sank to a six-year low on Monday, falling below $44 per barrel as the market was plagued by plentiful supplies and the strong dollar.In earlier deals, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for April delivery dived as low as $43.57 -- hitting the lowest since March 12, 2009.The contract later recovered slightly to stand at $44.40, down 44 cents from Friday�s closing level. European benchmark Brent North Sea crude for April fell 79 cents to $53.38 a barrel in midday London trade.Crude futures had plunged by more than two dollars on Friday after the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned of US crude reserves reaching storage capacity with little sign of a slowdown in output despite a global glut. \"Selling pressure was generated on Friday by the IEA, which warned that storage capacities could soon be exhausted in the United States,\" said Commerzbank analysts.\"The reason cited by the IEA was the massive oversupply, which stems first and foremost from the still rising US oil production.\"The US Department of Energy last week said stockpiles in the world�s top crude consumer climbed to a fresh record high of 448.9 million barrels last week. \"This week could be even more bearish for oil as there has been no shift in supply,\" Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney, told AFP. Singapore-based Phillip Futures said \"with fundamentals remaining unchanged, we hardly find a reason for crude oil to break higher or even lower\". Crude prices lost some 60 percent of their value to decline to about $40 per barrel between June and late January owing to an oversupply in world markets, a weak global economy and the soaring dollar.Prices have since rebounded following a slowdown in US oil-drilling activities, but analysts say volatility is likely to continue for some time.\"Behind the facade of stability, the rebalancing triggered by the price collapse has yet to run its course, and it might be overly optimistic to expect it to proceed smoothly,\" the Paris-based IEA, which advises energy consuming nations, said last week. McCarthy said oil prices are also under pressure owing to gains in the dollar against other major currencies ahead of a closely watched US Federal Reserve policy meeting on Wednesday. A stronger US dollar makes dollar-priced oil more expensive for buyers using weaker currencies, denting demand. (AFP)",

It later stood at $42.70, down $1.18 from Monday�s close.Nearing midday in London, European benchmark Brent North Sea crude for May delivery fell $1.14 to $52.80 a barrel.Crude futures also dropped Monday on worries over growing US oil inventories, which already stand at record-high levels adding to the global oversupply.In addition, the market fell sharply after OPEC questioned the strength of last month�s rally, saying in a report that the price increase came \"despite the fact that global supply continued to exceed demand\".Traders are now eagerly awaiting Wednesday�s weekly US government report on crude reserves for the week to March 13.\"Growing concerns that US crude stockpiles would see additional builds this week pushed prices lower,\" said Sucden analyst Kash Kamal.A Bloomberg News survey showed US crude stockpiles are expected to have increased by 3.3 million barrels to 452.2 million last week.US crude stockpiles have risen for nine weeks in a row to reach a record 448.9 million barrels on March 6.Singapore�s United Overseas Bank said the recent price decline was due to \"concerns that US crude supplies are at record levels and continue to build up\".World oil prices have collapsed by more than half since June last year on mounting US supplies, weak global economic growth and OPEC�s decision to keep output high despite falling prices.Leading US energy producers have curtailed some investment, resulting in lower weekly rig counts.Despite the reduced drilling, Goldman Sachs estimated Monday that US output would still grow by 230,000 barrels a day in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with a year ago.

    "Article": "Tokyo: The dollar struggled to recover Thursday after diving on comments from the US Federal Reserve that cooled expectations of an early summer interest rate hike.In Tokyo, the greenback briefly fell below 120 yen before ticking up to 120.22 yen by midday, well down from 121.35 yen level in Tokyo before the US central bank�s announcement. The euro changed hands at $1.0809 and 129.92 yen, down from $1.0871 and 130.54 yen in New York but still well above $1.0595 and 128.57 yen in Asia on Wednesday.While the US central bank opened the door for a rise from six years of zero percent rates, it lowered its forecasts for economic growth and inflation and stressed it would remain cautious before making any move.\"It�s fair to say we now have somewhat stronger doubt that Fed rates �lift-off� will begin a early as June, than we did heading into the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee)\" meeting, National Australia Bank said.\"The key takeaway is that (Fed chief Janet) Yellen has successfully established in the market�s mind the data, rather than date, dependency of Fed policy.\"After a two-day meeting, the Fed on Wednesday issued a statement that removed a pledge to remain \"patient\" on raising interest rates, signalling a possible mid-year rate increase.However Yellen stressed growth prospects were more muted than three months ago, despite strong increases in jobs creation. She noted consumer spending has slipped, inflation has declined, wages are flat, and the stronger dollar has hurt US exports.The policy committee lowered its rate outlook to 0.5-0.75 percent for the end of this year from 1.0 percent previously, while also reducing its 2016 forecast to 1.75-2.5 percent from 2.5 percent. \"Just because we removed the word patient from the statement doesn�t mean we�re going to be impatient,\" Yellen told reporters.Markets have been focusing on the Fed�s timing for a rate hike -- a plus for the dollar -- with Yellen�s comments giving much-needed relief for the euro, which has been hammered by the European Central Bank�s new stimulus programme.While some analysts pegged the dollar to fall further, loose monetary policy in major economies was likely to stem its losses, said Sebastien Galy, a senior currency strategist at Societe Generale.\"The dollar will resume its uptrend vs G10 in the next few weeks driven by the pressure of negative interest rates elsewhere,\" he wrote in an e-mail, according to Bloomberg News.
